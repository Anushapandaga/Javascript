        Total cost:
        The value of fixed and variable factors of production employed by
        the business firm to produce a given level of output is called total
        cost. Output is the result of combining together fixed and variable
        factors in required proportions. The fixed factors are plant,
        machinery, salaries to permanent employees etc. The variable
        factors are rawmaterial, fuel, power charges, other working
        expenses etc. Therefore, the total cost consists of fixed and
        variable costs together. As the volume of output increases the total
        cost also increases. In the short run, the shape and position of total
        cost curve is influenced by the nature of returns experienced by the
        business firm. Where as in the long run the shape and position of
        total cost curve is determined by the nature of returns to scale.
